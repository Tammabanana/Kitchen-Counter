  <description>The Kitchen Counter is the equipment rack, re-purposed to hold food instead of weapons. Art provided by Thundercraft!
  
  Update, 12/21/2016: In the past I've pointed people to other storage mods for items beyond foods, but I'm not sure how many of the other storage-solution mods are A16'd yet. So I've pulled some graphics from CuproPanda's "CorePanda" mod, and made 1x1 racks for:
	(a) "Food cache": foods (like the Kitchen Counter, but 1x1);
	(b) "Medicine cabinet": medicine and drugs (defaults to just medicine);
	(c) "General shelving": Anything. (I made this one require 2x resources and work, because some of that stuff is HEAVY, so shelving for it should be sturdier. Also out of a vague sense of balance, since it's so broad.</description>
